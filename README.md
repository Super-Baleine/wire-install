Script I made to install wire on my desktop.

That's split in several functions, use the ones you want.

# Usage

```shell
source install.sh
function_you_want;
```

### To install it automatically

```shell
source install.sh;
all_install;
wire;
```

# How to run Wire
```shell
wire;
```
Once you typed this command, you can quit the terminal.

Wire's [website](http://wire.com).

Use the wire function with the user you use to do the chown command.
